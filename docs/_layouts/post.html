 Crime has always been a promenent topic of concern in the modern world. From petty theft to horrible acts of violence, 
 the range of crimes is vast. However, the categories of crime has been somewhat static over the course of time, with only a 
 few new types of crimes appearing. But what one may could be subject to change when talking about crime over time, is the amount
 of crimes committed. Do we hear more and more about crime because more crimes are comitted? Or are we merely more informed about
 the crimes which are comitted? 
 San Francisco has for a long time been a crime hotspot, not only in the United States, but in the world. Even people in
 Europe are hearing about the crimes of San Francisco. In particular, crimes such as theft are frequently discussed. In this 
 paper, the evolution of larceny crimes in San Francisco over the timespan of 2003 - 2017 will be explored.

            <p>Firstly, let us investigate if there is an increase or decrease in larceny crimes from 2003 to 2017. In order 
			to do this, a couple of visualizations come to mind. A simple bar plot with the years on the x-axis and the amount of
			crimes on the y-axis would do the trick. But then a lot of information could be lost in the binning of data. Instead, a 
			date plot could be usefull. This way, it is possible to identify patterns on weekdays, weeks, months and years all in one.
			The dateplot is particularly great as it does not feel too cluttered eventhough many aspects can be investigated. Below, is the
			dateplot for the crime data.
