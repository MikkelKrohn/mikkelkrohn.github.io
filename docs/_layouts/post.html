 Crime has always been a promenent topic of concern in the modern world. From petty theft to horrible acts of violence, 
 the range of crimes is vast. However, the categories of crime has been somewhat static over the course of time, with only a 
 few new types of crimes appearing. But what one may could be subject to change when talking about crime over time, is the amount
 of crimes committed. Do we hear more and more about crime because more crimes are comitted? Or are we merely more informed about
 the crimes which are comitted? 
 San Francisco has for a long time been a crime hotspot, not only in the United States, but in the world. Even people in
 Europe are hearing about the crimes of San Francisco. In particular, crimes such as theft are frequently discussed. In this 
 paper, the evolution of larceny crimes in San Francisco over the timespan of 2003 - 2017 will be explored.

            <p>Firstly, let us investigate if there is an increase or decrease in larceny crimes from 2003 to 2017. In order 
			to do this, a couple of visualizations come to mind. A simple bar plot with the years on the x-axis and the amount of
			crimes on the y-axis would do the trick. But then a lot of information could be lost in the binning of data. Instead, a 
			date plot could be usefull. This way, it is possible to identify patterns on weekdays, weeks, months and years all in one.
			The dateplot is particularly great as it does not feel too cluttered eventhough many aspects can be investigated. Below, is the
			dateplot for the crime data.

This is a multi figure plot with a table figure for every year in the period. On the global y-axis is the years. On the
 individual x-axis the months are labeled. A box is a date and the more dark green the box is, the more crime has happened
 that day. The lighter a box is in color, the lesser amount of crime has happened. 
 Instantly, glancing over the figure there is a sense of increasing crime as time goes by. But it happens rather interestingly.
 Somewhere around 2012-2014, the summer months become more littered with crime. And around 2015, the increase in crime seems to
 expand to the entire year. One could speculate that the presidential elections in 2012 and 2016 could have had a role to play.
 But with this data, that is speculative at best.
 
 Now that we see an increase in crime overall as time goes by, it could be interesting to see whether all of the crime happens 
 in one location or in multiple scattered over San Francisco. Two methods of investigating this comes to mind. A division of
 the city into its districts and the counting the crimes within those districts. Or a more general heatmap over the entire city.
 Both visualizations are great. Let us have a look at the more general heat map approach. 
 
 We discovered in the previous visualization that months of a year differs in its amount of larceny crime. It is only 
natural that we investigate the months rather than whole years in this next plot.  </p>
